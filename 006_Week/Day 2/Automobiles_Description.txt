   -- Kibler,~D., Aha,~D.~W., \& Albert,~M. (1989).  Instance-based prediction
      of real-valued attributes.  {\it Computational Intelligence}, {\it 5},
      51--57.
	 -- Predicted price of car using all numeric and Boolean attributes
	 -- Method: an instance-based learning (IBL) algorithm derived from a
	    localized k-nearest neighbor algorithm.  Compared with a
	    linear regression prediction...so all instances
	    with missing attribute values were discarded.  This resulted with
	    a training set of 159 instances, which was also used as a test
	    set (minus the actual instance during testing).
	 -- Results: Percent Average Deviation Error of Prediction from Actual
	    -- 11.84% for the IBL algorithm
	    -- 14.12% for the resulting linear regression equation

4. Relevant Information:
   -- Description
      This data set consists of three types of entities: (a) the
      specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b)
      its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use
      as compared to other cars.  The second rating corresponds to the
      degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates.
      Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its
      price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is
      adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this
      process "symboling".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is
      risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.

      The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured
      vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a
      particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons,
      sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car
      per year.

   -- Note: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a
            "class" attribute.
